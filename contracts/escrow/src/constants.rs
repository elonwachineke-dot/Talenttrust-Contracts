//! Deterministic policy constants and checked arithmetic for the escrow contract.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! A boundary value that decides whether an operation succeeds, fails with a
//! typed error, or is rejected must be defined exactly once. When a limit or an
//! increment is written as a literal at each call site, two paths that are
//! supposed to behave identically can diverge — one wraps on overflow while the
//! other rejects, one accepts a value while the other refuses it. Failure
//! recovery then depends on *which* path happened to run, which is the
//! non-determinism this module removes: every limit and every increment used by
//! the recovery paths below is owned here and shared by every caller.
//!
//! # The pending reputation-credit recovery ledger
//!
//! `DataKey::PendingReputationCredits(freelancer)` is a durable counter of
//! "this freelancer completed a contract and is therefore owed one reputation
//! issuance":
//!
//! * **Accrual** — exactly one credit is added whenever a contract reaches
//!   [`crate::ContractStatus::Completed`], on every terminal path (final
//!   milestone release, batch settlement, partial-refund completion, and
//!   arbiter dispute resolution). A fully `Refunded` contract never accrues.
//! * **Consumption** — exactly one credit is removed by `issue_reputation`, the
//!   only way a completion becomes a stored reputation record.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! | # | Invariant |
//! |---|-----------|
//! | I1 | A stored ledger value is always within `0..=MAX_PENDING_REPUTATION_CREDITS`. |
//! | I2 | An accrual changes a ledger by exactly `REPUTATION_CREDIT_INCREMENT`; a consumption removes exactly the same amount. |
//! | I3 | Accrual past the ceiling and consumption from an empty ledger are *rejected* — never wrapped, saturated, or silently clamped. |
//! | I4 | Rejection is reported as `None` from the pure helpers, so the caller raises a typed contract error (`Error::PotentialOverflow` / `Error::NotCompleted`) and the stored ledger is left unchanged. A retry therefore observes exactly the same state and fails the same way. |
//!
//! The helpers below are the only supported arithmetic for that ledger, and the
//! `const` assertions at the end of this file turn an inconsistent policy into a
//! compile-time failure instead of a runtime surprise.
