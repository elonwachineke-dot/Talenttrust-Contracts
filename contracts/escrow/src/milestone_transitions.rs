/// - ✓ = Valid transition

/// - ✗ = Invalid transition (rejected with stable error)
///
/// **Intended State Machine Lifecycle:**
/// 1. Milestone created as **Pending** (default state)
/// 2. Can transition to **Released** via `release_milestone` (client, arbiter, or multi-sig approval)
/// 3. Can transition to **Refunded** via `refund_unreleased_milestones` (client-only, respects deadline)
/// 4. Once **Released** or **Refunded**, no further transitions allowed (terminal states)
/// 5. Contract-level cancellation or dispute resolution may affect availability of operations
///    but do not directly change individual milestone states
///
/// **Disagreement Resolution (from Issue #1340):**
/// Previously, both `refund_unreleased_milestones` and `cancel_contract` could refund
/// during dispute, but with different rule sets (deadline checking in refund vs. none in cancel).
