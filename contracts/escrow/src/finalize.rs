//! Immutable close records for finished escrow contracts.
//!
//! # Finalization invariants
//!
//! Finalization is the terminal, one-shot state transition of a contract. The
//! following invariants hold for every execution of
//! [`finalize_contract_impl`] and are relied upon by every other mutating
//! entrypoint (they all guard through [`Escrow::require_not_finalized`]):
//!
//! 1. **Write-once** — at most one [`FinalizationRecord`] exists per
//!    `contract_id`. The record is written through
//!    [`crate::settlement::write_finalization`], which refuses to overwrite an
//!    existing record, and the duplicate-work guard runs before any mutation.
//! 2. **First writer wins / deterministic losers** — of two racing or repeated
//!    calls for the same contract, exactly one succeeds. Every other attempt
//!    panics with [`Error::AlreadyFinalized`] *before* touching state, so it
//!    publishes no event, clears no rollback record and cannot be partially
//!    applied. Retrying is therefore safe and idempotent: the observable state
//!    after N attempts equals the state after one.
//! 3. **Durable guard** — the record's TTL is set to
//!    [`crate::ttl::PERSISTENT_TTL_LEDGERS`] when written, refreshed whenever
//!    the guard is consulted ([`Escrow::is_finalized`]) and refreshed whenever
//!    the contract entry it guards is extended (see
//!    [`crate::ttl::extend_contract_ttl`]). The record can therefore never be
//!    evicted while the contract entry is still live, which keeps
//!    `AlreadyFinalized` and `get_finalization_record` consistent for the whole
//!    life of the contract.
//! 4. **No reentrancy surface** — this path performs no token transfer and no
//!    cross-contract call, so there is no external code that could re-enter the
//!    escrow between the guard check and the record write. The record write is
//!    the terminal claim and every other effect follows it.
//! 5. **Freeze before mutation** — the pause/emergency gate runs before any
//!    state is written, so a paused or emergency-frozen escrow cannot be
//!    closed. Authorization runs before the finalizer role is evaluated.
//! 6. **Checked accounting** — the summary snapshot uses checked arithmetic, so
//!    a contract whose `funded - released - refunded` accounting is inconsistent
//!    fails loudly with [`Error::AccountingInvariantViolated`] instead of
//!    writing a silently wrong `refundable_balance`.
