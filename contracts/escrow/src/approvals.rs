//! Milestone approval storage and release authorization checks.
//!
//! This module owns the
//! `DataKey::MilestoneApprovals(contract_id, milestone_index)` records used by
//! `approve_milestone_release`, `revoke_milestone_approval`, and
//! `release_milestone`. It reads the escrow contract and milestone vector to
//! validate state and role authorization, but it does not move funds or mutate
//! milestone accounting.
//!
//! Approval records live in Soroban temporary storage and expire according to
//! `PENDING_APPROVAL_TTL_LEDGERS`. Missing or expired approvals fail closed.
//!
//! # Approval state machine
//!
//! An approval record is a set of at most three independent, per-party boolean
//! flags (`client_approved`, `freelancer_approved`, `arbiter_approved`) plus
//! the Soroban temporary-entry TTL. Which flags are *required* is derived
//! purely from the contract's [`ReleaseAuthorization`] mode:
//!
//! | Mode | Required flags |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `ClientOnly` | client |
//! | `ArbiterOnly` | arbiter |
//! | `ClientAndArbiter` | client **or** arbiter |
//! | `MultiSig` | client **and** freelancer |
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! The following invariants hold for every code path in this module. They are
//! the contract that makes failure recovery deterministic.
//!
//! **I1 — Fail closed.** A missing or TTL-evicted record is indistinguishable
//! from "never approved" and always denies release. Eviction can therefore
//! never *widen* authority; it can only force a fresh approval.
//!
//! **I2 — Revocation is authority-reducing and monotonic.** [`revoke_approval`]
//! can only clear a flag that is already set, and only the caller's own flag.
//! It has no path that sets a flag. Consequently revocation can never move a
//! milestone from *insufficient* to *sufficient* approvals, and it is safe to
//! allow from any contract state — there is no interleaving of concurrent
//! revoke/approve calls that can produce a release that neither party agreed to.
//!
//! **I3 — Revocation never extends a deadline.** A revoke clears a flag but
//! does not bump the temporary entry's TTL, so the remaining parties' approvals
//! keep the expiry they were originally granted. Recovery therefore cannot be
//! used to silently prolong an approval window. To obtain a fresh window a
//! party revokes and re-approves, which resets the TTL as a deliberate act.
//!
//! **I4 — Empty records are removed.** When the last set flag is cleared the
//! whole record is removed rather than persisted as an all-false entry, so the
//! observable state after full revocation is byte-identical to the state before
//! any approval was given.
//!
//! **I5 — Terminal milestones are immutable.** Neither approving nor revoking
//! is possible once a milestone is released
//! ([`Error::MilestoneAlreadyReleased`]). A revoked record can never be
//! resurrected for a settled milestone.
//!
//! **I6 — Disputes void approvals.** A dispute is an assertion that the prior
//! release authorization was invalid. [`raise_dispute`](crate::Escrow::raise_dispute),
//! [`rollback_dispute`](crate::Escrow::rollback_dispute), and
//! [`resolve_dispute`](crate::Escrow::resolve_dispute) therefore all call
//! [`clear_all_approvals`]. Without this, an approval recorded *before* a
//! dispute would be restored to a releasable state by a rollback and could be
//! spent without any party re-consenting.
//!
//! # Failure recovery
//!
//! Every recoverable approval failure has exactly one deterministic repair, and
//! no repair requires waiting out the TTL:
//!
//! | Situation | Repair |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | Approval recorded but should not have been | `revoke_milestone_approval` |
//! | Partial `MultiSig` set, one party unavailable | Wait for the party, or the arbiter resolves the dispute |
//! | Record evicted by TTL, release denied with `InsufficientApprovals` | Re-approve; [`MilestoneReleaseReadiness`] shows the record is gone |
//! | Release denied and the cause is unclear | [`get_milestone_release_readiness`](crate::Escrow::get_milestone_release_readiness) |
//! | Dispute opened, then rolled back | Approvals are already void (I6); re-approve |
//!
//! Duplicate approval remains a typed rejection ([`Error::AlreadyApproved`])
//! rather than a silent success, so "I did not mean to do this" is always
//! distinguishable from "this was already done". Because approval and
//! revocation are both flag operations against on-ledger state, a retry after
//! an unknown outcome (dropped receipt, RPC timeout) is always safe: read the
//! state with `get_milestone_release_readiness`, then either re-approve,
//! revoke, or take no action.
