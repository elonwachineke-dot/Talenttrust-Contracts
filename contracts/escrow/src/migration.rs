//! Client migration and per-contract storage schema upgrade logic.
//!
//! ## Client migration (two-step transfer)
//!
//! Client identity migration follows a **propose → accept** flow so that both
//! the current client and the proposed client must independently authorise the
//! change.  A pending record is written to **temporary** storage with a 21-day
//! TTL; auto-eviction enforces the acceptance window without any cleanup code
//! path.
//!
//! ### Invariants
//! 1. Only the stored `contract.client` may propose a migration.
//! 2. The proposed address must not overlap any existing role (client,
//!    freelancer, arbiter, escrow contract address).
//! 3. Migrations are blocked on terminal contract statuses: `Completed`,
//!    `Cancelled`, `Refunded`, `Disputed`.
//! 4. At most one pending migration may exist per contract at any time.
//! 5. Only the proposed address may accept the migration.
//! 6. Role-overlap is re-validated at acceptance time (roles may have changed
//!    between proposal and acceptance).
//! 7. Only the current client may cancel a pending migration.
//! 8. Cancel is blocked on terminal contract statuses (same guard as propose).
//! 9. TTL is bumped on every read of the pending record to prevent
//!    eviction during an active usage window.
//!
//! ## Per-contract storage schema migration
//!
//! The `Contract` struct has evolved over time.  To avoid a forced global
//! re-write every time a new field is added, contract records carry a
//! per-record schema version stored under `DataKey::ContractSchemaVersion(id)`.
//!
//! The canonical read helper (`load_contract_migrated`) applies a
//! **migrate-on-read** strategy:
//!
//! * If the version marker is absent (legacy record written before versioning),
//!   the record is decoded as `ContractV1`, the missing fields are filled with
//!   their safe defaults, and the upgraded `Contract` (v2) is written back in
//!   place.
//! * If the version marker equals `CONTRACT_STORAGE_SCHEMA_VERSION`, the record
//!   is returned as-is (fast path, no write).
//!
//! This is idempotent and safe under concurrent reads: a redundant upgrade
//! (two invocations arriving simultaneously) writes the same value and leaves
//! storage in the same correct state.
